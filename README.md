# Mission-Rock-Events

This is a little project I built to allow residents of the Mission Rock neighborhood in San Francisco to see which events were happening either at Oracle Park or at the Chase Center, or potentially other things happening in the area. 

The goal is to have at a glance (either via widget or a quick launch of the app) a quick answer to the question: "Are there any events happening around me today?"

The reason you may want to know this as a resident are the following:

- parking implications
- traffic implications
- maybe you'd actually like to attend some of these events


The app runs on iOS exclusively for now. I'd be open to an Android version if someone wanted to help out on that front.
